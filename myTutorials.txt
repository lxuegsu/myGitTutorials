This is a simple tutorial to use github:

1) Open your github homepage using browser:
https://github.com/lxuegsu

2) click "+" on top right to add a new repository
   Name the repository, and initial it with README

3) On your local PC, git clone the new repository
$ git clone https://github.com/lxuegsu/myGitTutorials.git
Cloning into 'myGitTutorials'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.

4) setup you username and email
git config --global user.name lxuegsu
git config --global user.email lxue1985@gmail.com


5) Add and commit new files
$ git add myTutorials.txt 
$ git commit -m "a simple git tutorial" myTutorials.txt

6) push the new file to "https://github.com"
$ git push
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

  To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

    git config --global push.default simple

	When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
	to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

	In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative 'simple'
	behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
	remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

	See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
	(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
	 'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

8) You use "git pull" to pull out the latest version from github
$ git pull

9) If you have multiple people working on the same project, and the the codes already changed by others
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/branch
